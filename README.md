## Can I scrape legitamate links?
 
Absolutely,not!
Yep thats right just looks clean doesn't really work

## So you might be wondering is it going to remain like this?
Absolutely! Not!
I will work hard.
As AI is a bit too overpowered to not abuse it
Anyways I'm going to keep writing until you know everything about this project.
So I've been wondering about use cases and there's so many its amazing really!
I've been making this really good flipsniper project which will need tools like this to analyse if it's a scam or not because it always goes fo the cheapest listings as any flip sniper would aspire
The main reason I'm doing the readme.md myself is to have a chance to remove the used AI mark on project
That would give me the edge over other projects and you'd vote for mine right?
Anyways my goal with this challenge is to get my own domain and maybe some web hosting and API keys for my FlipSniper project
If I get enough I won't be buying any of those I'll be aiming for the 3d printer or nintendo switch 2 cus who doesn't love creativity and fun?
If your reading this is a sign to vote for me!
## Next project
I'll be adding this to my FlipSniper project for sure if this works just hoping I don't get sued
Next project from me after I finish this massively annoying project I'll be creating another FlipSniper sub-tool or a school helping project
So what it is you can upload exam papers and it should be able to convert the pdf into a text file which contains all the questions in seperte lines so it can be accessed easily
## You may be wondering what's the point of that?
Well I'll be creating another tool
It takes text files containing seperate questions sperated by new lines and then categorises all of the questions into categories you want and it also adds it into it's database
So when you have a test coming up only on inertial mass I'll have another tool that scans this database and takes all questions related to inertia
If you don't know what inertia is its basically newton's first law but it says that more mass object require more force to move it(NO SHIT)

## SCRAPING NOT WOKRING?!?!
that means its outdated now ):
So Need to find another way to scrape - 14/8/25
